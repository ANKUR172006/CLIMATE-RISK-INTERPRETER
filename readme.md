# 🌍 Climate Risk Interpreter

### Theme
Climate Analytics | Sustainability | Public Policy

### Problem
Global climate datasets are difficult to interpret for real-world decision-making. This project translates long-term climate trends into interpretable risk signals and policy-relevant insights.

### Features
- Long-term warming trend detection
- Baseline-based temperature anomalies (1850–1900)
- Regional risk amplification
- Policy-oriented summaries
- Responsible, explainable projections

### Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### Disclaimer
This tool provides **interpretive insights**, not deterministic climate predictions.
